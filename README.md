# Solita Dev Academy 2021 excercise

Made with HTML/CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. Live demo at [git.hanki.dev/solita-dev-academy-2021](https://git.hanki.dev/solita-dev-academy-2021)

## Assignment

This excercise was made in order to apply for Solita's Dev Academy. You can see the assignment [here](https://github.com/solita/dev-academy-2021)

## Future plans

If I have time, I would still like to do these:

- Drop jQuery dependency
- Recreate using Mithril or React
